## Description

This is a simple implementation of the Hangman game,that is played in the terminal. It involves a player trying to guess a secret word by guessing individual letters. The player starts with a certain number of lives, which decreases every time a wrong letter is guessed. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or exhausts all their lives.

This project was built using Python, focusing on basic programming principles like loops, conditions, functions, and object-oriented programming. It provides a clean structure with clear functions and classes to organize the game's logic.
